        <strong>Freshman App Academy</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="coulmn">
        <p class="top">This project was an assignment I completed my freshman year of high school. Each person in the class was tasked to make a game using Unity. My first attempt resulted in a poorly working pacman. However my second time making a game resulted in a endless platform runner shown by the screenshot below. The name I chose for the game was The End Runner, kind of has a creepy ring to it, probably sounded cooler as a freshman. The coding of this project was done in c# which was hard to learn, and the remainder was done with unity extensions such as managing screens and using the scenes to make the runner. </p>

        <p class="big">In this screenshot you can see the player on the left-side of the screen, partially cut off. You control the player only by pressing the spacebar to jump from platform to platform. The goal of the game is to last as long as possible by jumping to each consecutive platform. This project was fun because I have been interested in endless runners for a good while and seeing how to make one was an interesting experience. The best part of the project was completing the project.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Cannon Nielsen. I am a highschool junior at Pasadena Highschool. My favorite school subject is math. However science comes in a close second. Math is appealing to me mainly due its logical applicatoins and its laws. In math there is no way for a rule/law to ever not work if the conditions are met. An example would be the fundemental theoreum of calculus, which relates antiderivatives to continuious functions. An example where rules don't always apply occur in english such as the I before E except after C rule, an example being species or seize.</p>
