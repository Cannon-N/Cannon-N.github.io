        <strong>Non App Academy Project</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="coulmn">
        <p class="top">This project was an assignment for my Spanish class my sophomore year. For this assignment the class was split into many groups of 4, my group ended up being three of my friends and I. Each group was then tasked to make a movie preview/trailer. At the time the movie IT had not yet come out, this resulted in us deciding to make a spoof of the released trailer. Once we realized the scenes that we would have to make we then found a camera and began filming. We tried to use as little from the actual trailer however we ended up using some things from the actual trailer, one of the main things being the trailer music.</p>

        <p class="big">This scene was filmed at my house where we used steak knives in hopes to make the clown character appear to be more freaky however it looked more comical than anything. One o/f the hardest parts of this project was trying find spots in which we could replicate what was done in the trailer. Since we couldn't get a perfect replica of all the scenes we ended up making some of our own in order to fill in the missing time gap however it ended up working out. Overall it ended up being a blast with all the bloopers we ended up getting. This project has been one of the most interesting projects that I have done outside of the APP academy.  </p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Cannon Nielsen. I am a highschool junior at Pasadena Highschool. My favorite school subject is math. However science comes in a close second. Math is appealing to me mainly due its logical applicatoins and its laws. In math there is no way for a rule/law to ever not work if the conditions are met. An example would be the fundemental theoreum of calculus, which relates antiderivatives to continuious functions. An example where rules don't always apply occur in english such as the I before E except after C rule, an example being species or seize.</p>
