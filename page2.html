        <strong>Favorite Project</strong>

        <p class="top">This project is my favorite project out of all the ones I have completed during my time in the app academy. This project was a game that one of my friends and I made for our final. The project relies mostly on JavaScript, p5.js and Socket.io. The game is set up to be a two player boss battle. One of the players moves with wasd and shoots with r, the other player moves with the arrow keys and shoots with p. The major javascript components involve keycodes, arrays and moving projectiles. We decided to make a boss fight because we both enjoyed that style of game. We both play a fair amount of video games and wanted to make something that was manageable in our alloted time frame. From there we just found sprites that looked decent enough to make the game appear clean. From there we then worked on the code starting with the character movement and finishing with the boss fighting back. </p>

        <p class="big">This picture shows the boss however neither player is on the screen because both of them died. The players last for four shots then die. The ed bar across the bottom represents the bosses health and it decreases as the boss takes damage from the players shots. The players shoot bullets that once they reach the boss disappear so that the server doesn't become overloaded with elements in an array. The big zero at the top of the screen is the scores which changes as you hit the boss. The gray bars are platforms that the players can jump on in order to avoid the bosses shots.  </p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Cannon Nielsen. I am a highschool junior at Pasadena Highschool. My favorite school subject is math. However science comes in a close second. Math is appealing to me mainly due its logical applicatoins and its laws. In math there is no way for a rule/law to ever not work if the conditions are met. An example would be the fundemental theoreum of calculus, which relates antiderivatives to continuious functions. An example where rules don't always apply occur in english such as the I before E except after C rule, an example being species or seize.</p>
