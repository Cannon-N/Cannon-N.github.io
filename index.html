            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Cannon Nielsen. I am a high school junior at Pasadena High school. My favorite school subject is math. However science comes in a close second. Math is appealing to me mainly due its logical applications and its laws. In math there is no way for a rule/law to ever not work if the conditions are met. An example would be the fundamental theorem of calculus, which relates antiderivatives to continuous functions. An example where rules don't always apply occur in English such as the I before E except after C rule, an example being species or seize.</p>

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>On my free time I play volleyball, video games, and go biking. I developed an interest in volleyball in middle school. I played on my school team which was just for fun. However my sophomore year of high school my friends and I started a volley team. We played against most other schools but our games did not count because we were not a CIF team. The start of our junior year we would find out that we had started the first ever CIF approved mens volleyball team at PHS. Our season went alright for it being our second year playing as a team, however these experiences I have had with the sport has resulted in it being my favorite out of the many I have played.</p><p> I began playing videos games when I was around eight years old, my first game being pacman on the original atari console. I have since developed a passion for videos with the games i play ranging from mmo's to fps to rpgs. Biking has been a passion of mine for a long time mainly because it serves as a way for me to calm down and get my mind off of things. It allows for you to get a fresh breath of air while getting in some exercise and possibly going somewhere. I have tried mountain biking however the few times I have gone have resulted in me with scrapes, scratches and bruises. Although it is fun I think the safer route for me is to stick to biking on roads. </p>

            <h1>Plans</h1>
            <p>After I graduate from high school I plan to go to an out of state college, mainly so that I can figure out life on my own as soon as possible. While at college I plan to major in computer engineering and minoring in math or physics. While in college I would like to attempt to find a volleyball team and continue playing the sport in hopes of either playing for the college team and maybe reaching pro level as an adult. I plan to pursue a career working with coding after I graduate from college this being the reason why I plan to major in computer engineering. A specific career that would interest me would be game development. Since I already have a passion for games I would like to work on them and see how they are made so that I can get an understanding of the things that I have spent so much of my life doing.</p>
